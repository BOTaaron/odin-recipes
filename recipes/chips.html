        <h5>A Traditional British Chip </h5>

        <p>A recipe for traditional British chips. A healthier variant, cooked in the oven rather than fried.
            These will be less greasy and more seasoned for flavour. They use Maris Piper potatoes for that extra crisp.
        </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1kg Maris Piper Potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Your favourite herbs/spices</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Optionally peel the potatoes. This is not necessary as the skin is obviously edible but they will look better.</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into slices, and then into chip shapes. Place into a pot of water with salt.</li>
        <li>Gently boil the chips until they soften but don't fall apart. Strain off the water and let them cool a little on a flat tray so the water evaporates.</li>
        <li>Once dry, massage with oil and sprinkle over some salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices desired.</li>
        <li>Cook the chips in the oven for around 30 minutes at 200C, or until they have a nice crispy brown appearance.</li>
    </ol>
